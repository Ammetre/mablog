It started at the day before...

T-1D

I went to sleep... My family did. Me and my parents. Suddenly, my dad's phone started ringing. Worried about healths of relatives, dad went to see who it was. It was from the coaching institute for some reason. They wanted us to go to their office for the next day.
Why? Supposedly I've been a good student, and they wanted me to join them at the success party. Me on the other hand, was thinking about all the second-hand embarrassment. I've never done anything (well, maybe that was an overstatement, with AIR 30 in KVPY-SA) that significant in terms of ranks. I had a 4 digit JEE Mains rank!! The heck were the thinking when they invited me?

Morning...

The cab came at around 11 o'clock, and we went to their office, reaching at noon. And to our surprise, we were the only ones there! I mean, WHAT! Oh, by the way, did I tell you that the state JEE results were meant to come out that very day? The toppers' list would be released at 1:30pm, and everyone would be able to see their ranks from 3 o'clock.

Afternoon...

It's 1:35pm, and me and my parents are just chilling in a room, when suddenly... yes. Dad's phone rang.

It was one of my school friend.

I picked up, and he was like, "Bro, haven't you looked at the TV?" I said, "No, what happened?"
He said, "You ranked 8th."
I was overwhelmed, and couldn't believe his words. After promising him a party, we went out to see the TV in their office. All of the employees there had their eyes glued to that, and no one cared to tell us!

Then ensued the inevitables. Interviews, more interviews, and more interviews, and angry reporters not getting bites. And for the love of God, why would you ask a student what does he think about other students from his education board not getting a place in the list? Who the heck would I be to answer that? Do you know how much diplomacy I had to maintain? Other reporters were chill though, and it was fun to talk to them. The most frequently asked question was brought up as well though, "How many hours do you study per day?" And boy did I tell the truth! I don't care if people think that I'm lying by telling a smaller number; in fact, I took the upper bound!

It was tiring, and I am NOT going to go to the details of stuff. I can't even count how many calls I had to pick up, how many interviews I gave, and how many questions I had to cheat my way through. (ngl the last one was very very annoying)

Evening...

Finally I got home from everything, and all the relatives were told to call the next day. Y'know, They are happy anyway, and they will be happy the day after. But today, the reporters flooded me. And this was the time when the 1st wave of COVID-19 peaked, so we were all a bit scared. The education minister called me when I was returning, and he would visit us in near future (then future- now past). So right as we come out of the cab, what do we see? A reporter waiting for a bite. This guy, was standing there, waiting for me, for HOURS! Stunned by his determination, I gave him his well-coveted bite, and he left. But that was not the end of the day though, as political parties saw their chance, and came one-by-one, banging at my door. Two parties came that day, and one party told that they'll come after some time, as the understood what we were going through. Well appreciated, Sire!

And obviously the rush of reporters didn't stop as well. I had to give a bite at my home to another reporter. But then came my school headmaster. He came with a person from the state govrnment, and with him was some sweets, flowers, and a letter of appreciation from the Chief Minister. He didn't come in the housr, but we understood, as we all were in the middle of a raging pandemic. A whole study table full of souvenirs were there at the end of the day, and the cleanup took more than an hour. I was so tired that I passed out immediately after I laid down. That, truly, was a day and a half.

T+1D

Nothing much happened after that, some interviews, and the visit from political parties and a visit from the minister. Some other societies came, and a death threat came along, ruining my mood for a day.
