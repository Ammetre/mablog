I went to sleep... My family did. Me and my parents. Suddenly, my dad's phone started ringing. Worried about healths of relatives, dad went to see who it was. It was from the coaching institute fir some reason. They wanted us to go to their office for the next day.
Why? Supposedly I've been a good student, and they wanted me to join them at the success party. Me on the other hand, was thinking about all the second-hand embarrassment. I've never done anything that significant in terms of ranks. I had a 4 digit JEE Mains rank!! The heck were the thinking when they invited me?

Morning...

The cab came at aroung 11 o'clock, and we went to there office, and to our surprise, we were the only ones there! I mean, WHAT! Oh, by the way, did I tell you that the state JEE results were meant to come out that very day! The toppers' list would be released at 1:30pm, and everyone would be able to see their ranks from 3 o'clock.
